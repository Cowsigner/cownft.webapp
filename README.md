### Installation

#### Fork the project & clone it. Example:

```

To build the production package (generated in build folder of the project) :

#### 4. Customize the website UI :

##### 4.1 `App.css` : update 5 main CSS variables with your custom colors :

```
:root {
  --main-background-color: #343A50;

  --countdown-background-color: #433765;
  --main-text-color:#F7F6F4;
  --title-text-color:#3CBA8B;
}
```

Next to that, make sure to update background image by overwriting your own background PNG file in src/img folder.

##### 4.2 `public` folder :

- Update existing demo cool cats images (cool-cats.gif, logo.png) with your owns images in project `public` folder. Make sure to name them identically.
- Add your custom website title in `index.html` : `<title>Mint Page</title>`

##### 4.3 `Home.tsx` :

Scroll down down to line 380 (`return <main> [...]`) and start to update all titles/menu/text/images/text... as wished in the whole React HTML block.

That's it ! Enjoy your beautiful candy machine :)
